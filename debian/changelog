    blacklisted hosts (using fail2ban), etc.

    even if enabled, there might not be a log target)
  * man/{check-diskfree.8,check-passwd.8,check-setuid.8}: Clarify that these
    plugins are written to be run by checksecurity. Some of the plugins might

    (no .changes file were getting generated)
  * Change the logrotate definition so that it will not rotate empty files.
  * Introduce a /var/log/checksecurity/ where all the new plugin logs
    will get saved to. Preserve /var/log/setuid for the time being

      for all plugins unless redefined in the plugin configuration file.

checksecurity (2.0.7-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up all logfiles on purge as required by policy.
  * Modified checksecurity.weekly to use its own lockfile and fix the

checksecurity (2.0.7-6) unstable; urgency=low

    so does the check-passwd plugin too.
  * Proper GPL header to the checksecurity program as well as to all of
    the plugins.

checksecurity (2.0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix postinst's check for files so that the return code is always
    true, have the script run with -e and add also an 'exit 0'
    return status in any case. (Closes: #299811)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu, 17 Mar 2005 01:19:29 +0100

checksecurity (2.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopted package (Closes: #298573) 
  * Have the check_diskfree plugin mail to root the results of the test, if
    defined. Notice that the environment is currently cleaned up so that
    it will not work yet properly. This is the patch available in #232951
  * Fixed the formatting issue in the  check-setuid.8 manpage with the
    patch provided by Nicolas Francois (Closes: #274428)
  * Fixed the reference to checksecurity.conf in bin/checksecurity, the
    message now refers to checksecurity(8) (Closes: #276950)
  * Create /var/log/setuid with proper permissions (750), also, move the 
    files in postinst through a loop checking first if they exist 
    (Closes: #297691)
  * Rotate /var/log/setuid.changes, /var/log/diskfree.log and
    /var/log/checksecurity.log through logrotate instead of having this in
    the cron task, use dh_installlogrotate to install this.
  * Add Getopt::Long usage to bin/checksecurity and define a debug (-d or
    --debug option) (currently undocumented)
  * Introduce a 'period' argument in checksecurity (currently undocumented)
    which determines what checks should it run:
     - Modify global-checksecurity.conf so that diskfree and passwd checks
       are run daily and setuid is run weekly
     - Create a new checksecurity-weekly cron task that will run setuid
    This closes two long-standing bugs since users can adjust the 
    configuration now to their needs. (Closes: #138484, #31902)
  * Recommend: Tiger, logcheck, and integrity checkers, also
    suggest some programs to check if newer packages are available, 
    as bug #163813 has not been closed yet. 
    This is an interim solution in order to warn users that
    there are more (advanced) security checks available they might want
    to implement in addition to checksecurity.
  * Added Czech po-debconf translation provided by Jan Outrata 
    (Closes: #291576)

    - Check_setuid does not guard against CHECKSECURITY_EMAIL being
      undefined since it's disabled per default (Closes: #239336)

    - Added LOGFILE definition in cron task, this would make it easier
      to switch to a different logfile in order to fix #232951. However,
      the older LOGFILES would need to be handled in order to avoid
      cruft in the system.
    - Added a README.Debian that explains why the conffile is handled 
      as it is (Closes: #198933)
    - Check-diskfree now guards agains undefined vars and handles 
      mount points with spaces in the patch (Closes: #190928)
    - Added comment in checksecurity.conf file indicating how you can
      disable check-setuid completely. This will have to suffice
      until check-security provides a better mechanism for fine-grane
      control of plugin execution (Closes: #177120)
    - Filter only xfs mounts if the devine name is arla (Closes: #171980)
