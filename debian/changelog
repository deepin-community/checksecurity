checksecurity (2.0.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * plugins/check-setuid: Prevent error from find by putting
    -ignore_readdir_race as first option (Closes: 714152)
  * plugins/check-iptables-logs, man/check-iptables-logs.8: Add new plugin to
    check for iptables logs and provide information of attacked ports,
    blacklisted hosts (using fail2ban), etc.
  * etc/global-checksecurity.conf: Add information for the new plugin, this is 
    disabled by default (as systems might not have iptables configured and,
    even if enabled, there might not be a log target)
  * man/{check-diskfree.8,check-passwd.8,check-setuid.8}: Clarify that these
    plugins are written to be run by checksecurity. Some of the plugins might 
    not work if missing some environment variables (which are defined by
    checksecurity)
  * man/checksecurity.8: Add a reference to the new plugin check-iptables-logs
  * debian/control: Improve the package description with the recommendations
    made by Justin B Rye (Closes: #688070) 
  * debian/control: Add debsecan to the Recommends, this provides notification
    of vulnerabilities in the system and security updates (Closes: #253097)
  * etc/check-setuid.conf: Exclude more filesystems for the setuid checks as
    are system based filesystems
  * debian/po/tr.po: Add Turkish translation provided by Mert Dirik

checksecurity (2.0.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug in the CS_NFSAFS definition in etc/check-setuid.conf that prevents
    the script from matching any filesystem. This bug was, actually, making the

    Thanks go to Alessandro Vesely for spotting this bug and providing a fix.

  * debian/control: Adjust the maintainer's name

         error messages when encountering stale files (Closes: #583809)
  * etc/global-checksecurity.conf: Adjust comments associated to  
    CHECKSECURITY_EMAIL to point to bsd-mailx instead of mailx and 
    remove reference to cron. (Closes: #541636)
  * debian/control: Depend on util-linux (>= 2.15~rc1-1) which provides
    ionice.
  * debian/compat: Change from 4 to 5
  * debian/rules: Adjust calls to dh_clean

checksecurity (2.0.13ubuntu2) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Matt Zimmerman ]
  * plugins/check-setuid: Use ionice to set idle I/O scheduling priority for
    find(1) across the whole filesystem.

  [ James Westby ]
  * plugins/check-setuid: Use the -t option to ionice so that failures to set
    I/O priority don't stop the command running.
    - Depend on util-linux (>= 2.15~rc1-1) to ensure the feature is available.
    - Thanks Colin Watson.

checksecurity (2.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not report 'disk full' for filesystems mounted under /media.
    This includes the cdrom as well as possibly some other removal
    media like USB memories. Thanks to Tim Connors for
    detecting this bug and providing a patch (Closes: #514306)
  * Add some information in the both check-setuid's manpage and the
    configuration file related to false positives generated from /dev changes

    configuration will run this daily.
  * Modify check-setuid so that the changes are actually preserved
    (no .changes file were getting generated)
  * Change the logrotate definition so that it will not rotate empty files.
  * Introduce a /var/log/checksecurity/ where all the new plugin logs
    will get saved to. Preserve /var/log/setuid for the time being

checksecurity (2.0.7-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * New translations:
    - Galician translation provided by Jacobo Tarrio (Closes: #413460)

    - Make checksecurity preserve the CHECKSECURITY_EMAIL environment variable
      for all plugins unless redefined in the plugin configuration file.
    - Make check-diskfree use CHECKSECURITY_EMAIL (instead of MAILTO) to

checksecurity (2.0.7-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clean up all logfiles on purge as required by policy.
  * Modified checksecurity.weekly to use its own lockfile and fix the
    error message. We should not be using the same lockfile as
    checksecurity.daily since the tests being run by default don't overlap
    (Closes: #326871)
  * Use debhelper compatibility version 4
  * Fixed FSF address in debian/copyright
  * Updated the debian/copyright file with new authors

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Sat,  9 Jul 2005 15:43:04 +0200

checksecurity (2.0.7-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Checksecurity checks if you are root (effective uid) before running and
    so does the check-passwd plugin too.
  * Proper GPL header to the checksecurity program as well as to all of
    the plugins.

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu,  7 Apr 2005 09:28:24 +0200

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu, 17 Mar 2005 09:24:44 +0100

checksecurity (2.0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix postinst's check for files so that the return code is always
    true, have the script run with -e and add also an 'exit 0'
    return status in any case. (Closes: #299811)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu, 17 Mar 2005 01:19:29 +0100

checksecurity (2.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adopted package (Closes: #298573) 
  * Have the check_diskfree plugin mail to root the results of the test, if
    defined. Notice that the environment is currently cleaned up so that
    it will not work yet properly. This is the patch available in #232951
  * Fixed the formatting issue in the  check-setuid.8 manpage with the
    patch provided by Nicolas Francois (Closes: #274428)
  * Fixed the reference to checksecurity.conf in bin/checksecurity, the
    message now refers to checksecurity(8) (Closes: #276950)
  * Create /var/log/setuid with proper permissions (750), also, move the 
    files in postinst through a loop checking first if they exist 
    (Closes: #297691)
  * Rotate /var/log/setuid.changes, /var/log/diskfree.log and
    /var/log/checksecurity.log through logrotate instead of having this in
    the cron task, use dh_installlogrotate to install this.
  * Add Getopt::Long usage to bin/checksecurity and define a debug (-d or
    --debug option) (currently undocumented)
  * Introduce a 'period' argument in checksecurity (currently undocumented)
    which determines what checks should it run:
     - Modify global-checksecurity.conf so that diskfree and passwd checks
       are run daily and setuid is run weekly
     - Create a new checksecurity-weekly cron task that will run setuid
    This closes two long-standing bugs since users can adjust the 
    configuration now to their needs. (Closes: #138484, #31902)
  * Recommend: Tiger, logcheck, and integrity checkers, also
    suggest some programs to check if newer packages are available, 
    as bug #163813 has not been closed yet. 
    This is an interim solution in order to warn users that
    there are more (advanced) security checks available they might want
    to implement in addition to checksecurity.
  * Added Czech po-debconf translation provided by Jan Outrata 
    (Closes: #291576)

    (Closes: #272402)

    Move existing files into place on upgrade.
    (Closes: #164665)  (Closes: #59809)

    - Preinst now sorts /var/log/setuid.today before the upgrade 
      (Closes: #239340)
    - Check_setuid does not guard against CHECKSECURITY_EMAIL being
      undefined since it's disabled per default (Closes: #239336)
    - Introduced an alternative fix for the Arla partitions and
      add new arla type 'nnpfs' and 'binfmt_misc' (Closes: #239314)

checksecurity (2.0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU with maintainer's approval

    - Added LOGFILE definition in cron task, this would make it easier
      to switch to a different logfile in order to fix #232951. However,
      the older LOGFILES would need to be handled in order to avoid
      cruft in the system.
    - Added a README.Debian that explains why the conffile is handled 
      as it is (Closes: #198933)
    - Check-diskfree now guards agains undefined vars and handles 
      mount points with spaces in the patch (Closes: #190928)
    - Added comment in checksecurity.conf file indicating how you can
      disable check-setuid completely. This will have to suffice
      until check-security provides a better mechanism for fine-grane
      control of plugin execution (Closes: #177120)
    - Filter only xfs mounts if the devine name is arla (Closes: #171980)
